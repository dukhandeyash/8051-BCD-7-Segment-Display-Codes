# 8051 BCD 7 Segment Display Codes

This repository contains assembly code for the 8051 microcontroller to control a 7-segment display. It demonstrates flashing, moving, and displaying numbers on the 7-segment display.

## Files and Functionality

### 1. **Flashing Text**
   This code makes the text "SALE" flash on the 7-segment display. The sequence of flashing is repeated with a delay between each transition.

### 2. **Moving Text**
   This code moves the text "SALE" across the 7-segment display by sequentially displaying each character with a delay.

### 3. **Nine to Zero**
   This code displays numbers from 9 to 0 on the 7-segment display with a delay between each number.

### 4. **Normal Text**
   This code displays the text "SALE" on the 7-segment display without any flashing effect.
